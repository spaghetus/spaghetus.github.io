Hello! Welcome to my humble blog.

My current interests are, in no particular order: 
* Game design, using the Bevy or Godot game engines in particular.
* The Semantic Web
* Cryptography / secure communications
* Respectful software design
* Anime, VTubers (stay tuned for my vtuber debut if it ever happens lol)
* Trans rights

The source code for this blog is available at [github/spaghetus/spaghetus.github.io](https://github.com/spaghetus/spaghetus.github.io), and the commits available there can be checked against my [public key](keys) to guard against tampering.
