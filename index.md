# Willow's Blog

Hello! Welcome to my humble blog.

My current interests are, in no particular order: 
* Game design, using the Bevy or Godot game engines in particular.
* The Semantic Web (Web 3.0, it's like Web3 but completely different and also not dumb ðŸ˜‰)
* Cryptography / secure communications
* Respectful software design
* Anime, VTubers (stay tuned for my vtuber debut if it ever happens lol)
* Trans rights

The source code for this blog is available at https://github.com/spaghetus/spaghetus.github.io, and the commits available there can be checked against my [public key](keys.md) to guard against tampering.
