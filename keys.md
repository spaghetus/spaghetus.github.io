# Keys

As of 2021-11-11, I use GPG/PGP to sign all of my commits and binary releases.

My keys are known to be available on [pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.mit.edu), and have the following fingerprints:
* `FE21 E098 1CDF D50A DD08 6423 C21A 693B A469 3A60` - My personal key, which signs all of the other keys in this list.
* `7A43 9D88 4F34 F915 A63D C15A 8E5E 774E 31D7 9A4F` - The key used by ci.wolo.dev to sign its artifacts.

Feel free to publish a third-party signature for these keys with a low trust level if you wish. You shouldn't sign them with a high trust level unless you've checked with me in person, though.
